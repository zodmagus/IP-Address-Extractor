# IP Address Extractor

This Python program extracts IP addresses from a text file and saves them to a separate text document in order.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository or download the `extract_ips.py` file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt.

4. Run the program using the following command:

    ```bash
    python extract_ips.py <input_file_path> <output_file_path>
    ```

    Replace `<input_file_path>` with the path to your input text file and `<output_file_path>` with the desired path for the output text file.

5. The program will process the input file, extract IP addresses, and save them to the specified output file.
